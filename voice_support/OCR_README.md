3. The application will automatically detect the installation

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr-chi-sim  # For Chinese support
```

#### macOS
```bash
brew install tesseract
brew install tesseract-lang  # For additional language support
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone or Download the Project
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd voice_support
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/macOS
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r ocr_requirements.txt
```

### 4. Verify Tesseract Installation
```python
import pytesseract
print(pytesseract.get_tesseract_version())
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Running the Application
```bash
streamlit run rory_ai_assistant.py
```

The application will start and be available at: `http://localhost:8501`

### Document Processing
1. **Automatic Processing**: The app automatically processes all `.txt`, `.md`, and `.pdf` files in the current directory
2. **OCR Processing**: PDF files are processed using multiple extraction methods:
   - Text-based extraction (fastest)
   - OCR fallback for image-based PDFs
   - Chinese and English text recognition

### Interacting with the AI
1. **Direct Questions**: Type questions in the input box
2. **Sample Questions**: Click on pre-defined questions for quick answers
3. **Chat Interface**: Engage in ongoing conversations with the AI

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Document Processing Pipeline
1. **Text Files**: Direct UTF-8 encoding reading
2. **PDF Files**: Multi-stage extraction:
   - PyMuPDF for text-based PDFs
   - PyPDF2 as fallback
   - Tesseract OCR for image-based content

### AI Processing
1. **Vector Store**: Sentence-transformers for document embeddings
2. **Retrieval**: Cosine similarity search for relevant content
3. **Generation**: Qwen-Plus model for intelligent responses
4. **Fallback**: Local reasoning when API is unavailable

### Key Classes
- `EnhancedDocumentProcessor`: Handles OCR and document processing
- `OptimizedVectorStore`: Manages document embeddings and search
- `IntelligentGraphRAGChain`: Orchestrates AI reasoning and response generation

## üéØ Supported Query Types

### Factual Information
- Age estimation based on education timeline
- Experience duration calculations
- Contact information extraction
- Educational background details

### Analytical Queries
- Career progression analysis
- Technical skills assessment
- Industry experience evaluation
- Unique value proposition identification

### Conversational Queries
- General questions about Rory's background
- Project and achievement discussions
- Professional insights and perspectives

## üîç OCR Capabilities

### Supported Languages
- English (primary)
- Chinese Simplified (chi_sim)
- Additional languages can be added via Tesseract language packs

### PDF Processing Features
- **Text-based PDFs**: Direct text extraction
- **Image-based PDFs**: OCR conversion to text
- **Mixed PDFs**: Combination of both methods
- **Multi-page Support**: Processes entire documents
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for problematic files

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Tesseract Not Found
```
Error: Tesseract not found
```
**Solution**: Install Tesseract OCR and ensure it's in your system PATH

#### PDF Processing Fails
```
Error: Failed to process PDF
```
**Solutions**:
1. Check if the PDF is corrupted
2. Ensure sufficient memory is available
3. Try with a smaller PDF file first

#### Chinese Text Not Recognized
```
Warning: OCR failed for Chinese text
```
**Solution**: Install Chinese language pack for Tesseract:
```bash
# Linux
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr-chi-sim

# Windows: Download from Tesseract GitHub releases
```

#### Memory Issues
```
Error: Out of memory during processing
```
**Solutions**:
1. Process fewer documents at once
2. Increase system RAM
3. Close other applications

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Document Processing
- **Chunking**: Documents split into 300-word chunks with 30-word overlap
- **Filtering**: Very short chunks (<50 words) are filtered out
- **Batch Processing**: Embeddings generated in batches of 32

### OCR Optimization
- **Page Limiting**: OCR limited to first 10 pages for very large PDFs
- **Resolution Control**: Optimized image resolution for OCR accuracy
- **Language Detection**: Automatic language detection for better results

## üîê Security Considerations

### API Keys
- API keys are embedded in the code for demo purposes
- For production use, store API keys in environment variables:
```python
import os
api_key = os.getenv('QWEN_API_KEY')
```

### Data Privacy
- All document processing happens locally
- Only query text is sent to the AI API
- No document content is transmitted externally

## ü§ù Contributing

### Adding New Document Types
1. Extend `EnhancedDocumentProcessor.process_documents()`
2. Add new file extension handling
3. Implement appropriate text extraction method

### Improving OCR Accuracy
1. Adjust image preprocessing parameters
2. Add language-specific optimizations
3. Implement confidence scoring

### Enhancing AI Responses
1. Modify prompt templates in `_generate_intelligent_response()`
2. Add new intent types in `_analyze_query_intent()`
3. Extend factual reasoning methods
