## üöÄ Service Status

### Currently Running Services:
1. **Streamlit App (Port 8502)** ‚úÖ RUNNING
   - Enhanced Streamlit Assistant
   - Process ID: 46508
   - URL: http://1.32.228.33:8502

2. **Legacy Streamlit App (Port 8501)** ‚úÖ RUNNING
   - Existing web application
   - Process ID: 614
   - URL: http://1.32.228.33:8501

### Services Attempted to Start:
3. **ChromaDB Service (Port 8000)** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS VERIFICATION
   - Vector database for document storage
   - Started but needs health check

4. **Embedding API (Port 8001)** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS VERIFICATION
   - Text embedding service
   - Started but needs health check

## üîß Configuration Review

### ‚úÖ Environment Setup
- Python 3.10.12 detected
- Virtual environment created at `/root/code/venv`
- All dependencies installed from `vm_requirements.txt`
- Shell scripts converted from Windows line endings

### ‚úÖ File Permissions
- All shell scripts made executable
- Proper directory structure created
- Log files accessible

### ‚úÖ Network Configuration
- SSH access confirmed on port 64713
- Web services bound to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces)
- Ports 8501 and 8502 confirmed listening

## üìä Document Processing Status

### Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING
The document processing requires ChromaDB and Embedding API services to be fully operational. Initial attempt showed:
- Service connectivity issues to port 8000 (ChromaDB)
- Documents ready for processing in `/root/data/`
- Processing script available and configured

### Next Steps for Document Processing:
1. Verify ChromaDB service health on port 8000
2. Verify Embedding API service health on port 8001
3. Re-run document processing: `python3 process_root_documents.py`

## üåê Web Access

### Primary Application:
**Enhanced Streamlit Assistant**: http://1.32.228.33:8502
- Full-featured AI assistant interface
- Document chat capabilities
- ChromaDB integration (pending service verification)

### Legacy Application:
**Existing Web App**: http://1.32.228.33:8501
- Previously deployed application
- Currently functional

## üîç Health Check Commands

To verify all services are running properly:

```bash
# Check service processes
ssh -p 64713 root@1.32.228.33 "ps aux | grep -E '(streamlit|chroma|embedding)' | grep -v grep"

# Check listening ports
ssh -p 64713 root@1.32.228.33 "ss -tlnp | grep -E ':(8000|8001|8501|8502)'"

# Check service logs
ssh -p 64713 root@1.32.228.33 "tail -f /root/logs/*.log"

# Test document processing
ssh -p 64713 root@1.32.228.33 "cd /root/code && python3 process_root_documents.py"
```

## üéØ Deployment Achievements

### ‚úÖ Successfully Completed:
1. **File Upload**: All core application files transferred
2. **Environment Setup**: Python environment and dependencies installed
3. **Service Deployment**: Streamlit applications running
4. **Network Access**: Web interfaces accessible
5. **Data Preparation**: Documents uploaded and ready for processing
6. **Script Configuration**: All deployment scripts properly configured

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Verification:
1. **ChromaDB Service**: Confirm port 8000 accessibility
2. **Embedding API**: Confirm port 8001 accessibility
3. **Document Processing**: Complete embedding and storage workflow
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Verify full document chat functionality

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Access the Application:
